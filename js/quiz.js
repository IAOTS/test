Biofeedback is the name of medical technique that helps people treat certain problems by becoming more aware of their own bodies.In biofeedback\,instruments that measure bodily functions such as muscle tension\,temperature\,and blood flow are attached to the body.The instruments produce signals–for example\,a series of sounds(beeps) or a flashing light– that the person can hear or see.The patient then uses the information to help gain control over the function.The most widely used biofeedback instrument is the electromyograph\,or EMG.The EMG is used to measure muscle tension.It is made up of several electrodes\,which are placed on the skin near a particular area\,depending on the symptom.For example\, for headaches\, a symptom often caused by excessive tension in the neck muscles\,the electrodes are placed on the forehead or near the back of the neck.When the tension is present\,the EMG produces a signal and the patient is taught to respond by relaxing the appropriate muscles.In many cases\,the relaxation of these muscles causes the headache to go away. While biofeedback has not turned out to be a cure– all\,it has been used successfully to treat a limited number of problems– especially those caused by chronic tension.',
